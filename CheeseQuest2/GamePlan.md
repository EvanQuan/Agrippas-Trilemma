# Mechanics
## Day and Night cycle
Instead of a cave (or in addition to a cave), there is a day and night cycle, which requires the player to use a lantern to traverse outside of Airedale or be caught by the monster.
## Combat
Randomly in certain areas an enemy  will appear. It will initiate combat, which will enter a combat menu, and show player and enemy stats. It will be turn-based, and be similar to KOL combat.
