# New Mechanics
## Day and Night cycle
Instead of a cave (or in addition to a cave), there is a day and night cycle, which requires the player to use a lantern to traverse outside of Airedale or be caught by the monster.
## Combat
Randomly in certain areas an enemy  will appear. It will initiate combat, which will enter a combat menu, and show player and enemy stats. It will be turn-based, and be similar to KOL combat.
## Talking with NPCs
Two ways to implement
1. Free-form dialogue like in H2G2. More immersive. More difficult to implement, especially with invalid phrases.
2. Fixed dialogue options. Easier to implement and allows for conversations to be directed as they should. Less immersive (locks player in dialogue mode).
## World-altering events
Entirely towns can be altered by game events. Killed off, changed faction etc.
## Time travel
Visit areas in different periods of time, which can allow for time-based puzzles with movement and item placement.
