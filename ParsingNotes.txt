1. Break input into tokens (words, punctuation?)
Apostrophes
    - If 's it's possessive (separate token)
    - Else, part of contraction
    - single quote embedded string?

2. Match tokens with grammar.
Verb first (may come with preposition, which can show up in different places)
Commas serve many purposes (introducing the verb after the target character, separating noun phrases in a list, separating verb phrases)

3. Extract meaning of the sentence and do what it says.
Meaning (structure)
- Character
- Actor
- Verb
- Direct object (which also might be an array of direct objects)

Tricky
- Picking out the simulation object to which a particular noun phrase refers
- Check for Adjectives before each noun?
