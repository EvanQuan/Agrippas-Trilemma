# Cheese Quest: The Plague of Kashkaval

Cheese Quest is a text-based adventure game, inspired by many of the interactive fiction games published by Infocom. In particular, development was motivated by The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1984).

Cheese Quest 2 is in development in Java starting 2017, and attempts to correct a lot of the mistakes made in Cheese Quest 1, both in terms of code maintenance and scalability, and game mechanics/balance. Two main features to implement is the ability to save and load multiple game saves, and for it to run in a GUI using javax.swing and java.awt, with added buttons, and side inventory and goal displays for added convenience.
