# Cheese-Quest

Cheese Quest is a text-based adventure game inspired by The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy text adventure game developed by Infocom (1984).
Cheese Quest 1 was developed in Python in 2016-2017, prior to knowing anything about functions, classes etc. It is all programmed in a single file, and is terribly structured with large amounts of repeated, unorganized code.
Cheese Quest 2 is in development with Java, and attempts to correct a lot of the mistakes made in Chees Quest 1, both in terms of code maintenance and scalability, and game mechanics/balance.
