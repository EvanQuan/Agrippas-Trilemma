# Cheese Quest

Cheese Quest is a text-based adventure game, inspired by many of the interactive fiction games published by Infocom. In particular, development was motivated by The Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy (1984).

## Cheese Quest: The Plight of Kashkaval
Cheese Quest 1 was developed in Python from 2016 to 2017, prior to knowing anything about functions, classes etc., while I was taking my first intro to computer science course (CPSC 217). It is all programmed in a single file, and is terribly structured with large amounts of repeated, unorganized code. While it works and is relatively bug-free, it is a clear example of what not to do. The world spans over 100 rooms, and takes approximately 2 hour to complete.

## Cheese Quest: The Plague of Kashkaval
Cheese Quest 2 is in development in Java starting 2017, and attempts to correct a lot of the mistakes made in Cheese Quest 1, both in terms of code maintenance and scalability, and game mechanics/balance. Two main features to implement is the ability to save and load multiple game saves, and for it to run in a GUI using javax.swing and java.awt, with added buttons, and side inventory and goal displays for added convenience.
